# K8s communication via Http requests.

## About Repository:

This repository serves as a foundational project I've established to explore interaction with the Kube-api via HTTP requests from a Golang server, enabling operations such as reading, creating, updating, and deleting Kubernetes resources.

## Software(s) required:

* [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
